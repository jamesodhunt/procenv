# `procenv`

## Demo

[![demo](https://asciinema.org/a/118278.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/118278?autoplay=1)

## Overview

`procenv` is a simple command-line utility, written in C and licensed
under the GPL, that dumps all attributes of the environment in which it
runs, in well-structured plain ASCII, JSON (YAML), XML or CSV.

> **Note:**
>
> If you find anything missing from the `procenv` output, please either raise
> an issue or send a patch :)

It is useful as a test tool, to understand what environment a process
runs in and for system comparison.

`procenv` runs on the following operating systems:

- Android
- FreeBSD
- GNU Hurd
- GNU Linux
- Minix 3
- macOS
- NetBSD
- OpenBSD

It unashamedly emulates a number of existing system utilities as it is
attempting to be all-encompassing: I wrote it with the aim of being able to
dump "everything" that a process may care about by simply running a single
program (by default). Also, the line of demarcation between "process",
"program" and  "system" is slightly blurry in some aspects.  For example
`sysconf(3)` variables could arguably be considered system attributes, but
`procenv` shows these too since they are obviously meant to be queryable by
applications.

## Install

```

### FreeBSD

To install the binary package:

```bash
$ sudo pkg -y install procenv
```

To install the port:

```bash
$ cd /usr/ports/sysutils/procenv
$ sudo make install clean
```

### Gentoo

```bash
$ sudo emerge sys-process/procenv
```

### macOS

Install via [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/procenv/summary):

```bash
$ sudo port install procenv
```

### SUSE

```bash
$ sudo zypper install -y procenv
```

## Build

## Build snap package

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jamesodhunt/procenv
$ cd procenv
$ snapcraft
```

## Build from source

1. Install dependencies

   | Platform | Usage | Required? | Dependency | Rationale |
   |-|-|-|-|-|
   | common | build | yes | GCC or Clang compiler | For building the code |
   | common | build | yes | GNU Autoconf  | For configuring the source package |
   | common | build | yes | GNU Automake | For generating makefiles |
   | common | build | yes | GNU Make | For building the code |
   | common | build | yes | `pkgconf` / `pkg-config` | For configuring build dependencies |
   | common | test | optional | Check | For running unit tests |
   | common | test | optional | Expat | For validating XML output |
   | common | test | optional | GNU Groff | For checking man page documentation |
   | Linux | build | optional | `libapparmor` development package | For capabilities details |
   | Linux | build | optional | `libcap` development package | For capabilities details |
   | Linux | build | optional | `libnuma` development package | For NUMA memory details |
   | Linux | build | optional | `libselinux` development package | For SELinux details |
   | BSD | build | optional | `libsysinfo` package or port | For general memory details |

1. Checkout the source code:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/jamesodhunt/procenv
   $ cd procenv
   ```

1. Configure and build:

   ```bash
   $ autoreconf -fi && ./configure
   $ make && make check && sudo make install
   ```

   > **Note:**
   >
   > For BSD systems, replace `make` with `gmake` above to ensure you run using
   > GNU Make (BSD make will hang at the test stage!)

## Results

`procenv` is extremely useful for learning about the environment
software builds in. Often, such systems disallow login, but do allow
access to log files. Handily, when you build `procenv`, it runs a battery of
tests and *also runs itself*. This means that the build environment gets
captured in the build logs themselves.

Select a link below and drill down to the build log to see the `procenv`
output:

If you distro does not yet provide a `procenv` package, binary
packages for RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, SLES, and Arch Linux are available
from here:

Click on your icon for your distro and follow the instructions.

Note that these packages are "bleeding edge" (generated directly from the GitHub repository).

## Porting

Can you help port `procenv` to other platforms (AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, ...), or
can you give me access to new platforms? If so, please get in contact or take
a look at the [porting document](src/platform).
