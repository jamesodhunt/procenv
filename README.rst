Overview
--------

``procenv`` is a simple command-line utility, written in C and licensed
under the GPL, that dumps all attributes of the environment [#]_ in which
it runs, in well-structured plain ASCII, JSON (YAML), XML or CSV.

It is useful as a test tool, to understand what environment a process
runs in and for system comparison.

``procenv`` runs on the following operating systems:

- Android
- FreeBSD
- GNU Hurd
- GNU Linux
- Minix 3
- NetBSD
- OpenBSD
- OSX

The ``procenv`` tool unashamedly emulates a number of existing system
utilities as it is attempting to be all-encompassing: I wrote it with
the aim of being able to dump "everything" that a process may care about
by simply running a single program (by default). Also, the line of
demarcation between "process", "program" and  "system" is slightly
blurry in some aspects.  For example ``sysconf(3)`` variables could
arguably be considered system attributes, but procenv shows these too
since they are obviously meant to be queryable by applications.

.. [#] If you find anything missing, please either raise a bug or send a
       patch :)

Results
-------

``procenv`` is extremely useful for learning about the environment
software builds in. Often, such systems disallow login, but do allow
access to log files. Handily, ``procenv`` runs a battery of tests on
build including running itself so that the build environment gets
captured in the builds logs themselves. Select a link below and drill
down to the build log to see the ``procenv`` output:

Semaphore-CI
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* https://semaphoreci.com/jamesodhunt/procenv
  (Click "Passed", "Job #", then "``make check``" to see output).

Travis-CI
~~~~~~~~~

* https://travis-ci.org/jamesodhunt/procenv

Open Build Service (OBS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:jamesodhunt:procenv/procenv

If you distro does not yet provide a ``procenv`` package, binary
packages for RHEL, Fedora, Centos, SLES, and Arch Linux are available
from here:

* https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Ajamesodhunt%3Aprocenv&package=procenv

Click on your icon for your distro and follow the instructions.

Note that these packages are "bleeding edge" (generated directly from the github repository).
